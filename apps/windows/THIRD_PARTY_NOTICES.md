# Windows third-party notices / Windows 第三方声明

Windows 0.3.0 is a GPL-3.0-only port of OpenRemoteAssistant. Runtime dependency
versions below were read from the supplied EXE's embedded `.deps.json` and
`.runtimeconfig.json`. These components are not relicensed under GPL by this
notice; their own notices and terms are retained in `licenses/` and below.

| Distributed component | Version | License / upstream source |
|---|---|---|
| NAudio, Core, Midi, Asio, Dmo, Wasapi, WinForms, WinMM | 3.1.0 | MIT; [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/tree/0aaef29d04bec9567bdf2f669036fabecc33a2e2) |
| Cockos WDL resampler, via NAudio.Core | NAudio 3.1.0 snapshot | Original zlib-style notice retained; C# port by Mark Heath |
| .NET runtime | 9.0.8 | MIT and retained third-party notices; [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/v9.0.8) |
| WindowsDesktop runtime (WinForms / WPF) | 9.0.8 | MIT and retained notices; [WinForms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/tree/v9.0.8), [WPF](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/tree/v9.0.8) |
| System.Numerics.Tensors | 9.0.0 | MIT, .NET Foundation; [source](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/v9.0.0/src/libraries/System.Numerics.Tensors) |
| WebView2 managed controls and native loader | 1.0.2957.106 | Microsoft BSD-3-Clause license and NOTICE from the [exact NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2/1.0.2957.106) |
| Windows SDK .NET projection / WinRT support | 10.0.19041.57 targeting pack | Microsoft SDK terms; [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref/10.0.19041.57), [C#/WinRT MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/blob/2.2.0.241111.1/LICENSE) |

The .NET manifests also name ILLink.Tasks 9.0.8 (build tooling, not an application
feature). Tests use xUnit and Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk as declared in the test
project; test runners are not in the distributed application bundle. The setup
is produced by Inno Setup 6; see [Inno Setup licensing](https://jrsoftware.org/files/is/license.txt).

The **WebView2 browser runtime** must already be installed or obtained separately
from Microsoft; this release includes the SDK controls/loader, not an Edge
browser installer. **VB-CABLE is not bundled**; users obtain it under its own
terms. **OpenRemoteAudio / BlackHole and Apple frameworks are Mac-only** and are
not in the Windows EXE or setup. Neither upstream Windows binaries nor upstream
product photographs are included.

Windows build 18w is rebuilt from the public source and contains the corrected
HID matching rules. Full license materials are included in the installer and
portable ZIP. Keep the whole bundle together when redistributing. Matching application source and build/install
scripts are provided in the source asset at the same release tag.

## Retained project lineage (Mac-specific descriptions are historical)

The following original notices are preserved for source lineage. Their claims
about CoreAudio, Apple permissions, SwiftUI and Mac validation describe the
Mac implementation, not Windows runtime contents or Windows acceptance.

# Third-party notices

## Application protocol lineage

ATVV control handling and high-nibble-first IMA ADPCM decoding were adapted
from [Open Voice Bridge](https://github.com/nijez/open-voice-bridge), revision
`1796b149f752ff2d2fa82fd818f8a5a2bc60802a`, GPL-3.0-only, copyright 2026
Open Voice Bridge contributors. The upstream implementation credits
[remote-bridge-hub](https://github.com/xxb26553663-star/remote-bridge-hub),
revision `8a93f321ac71a602300c6cd77f7256fa4b63068e`, GPL-3.0-only.

Our modified implementation targets the RC003-MS retail model, whose device
information service reports RC003 / MIOM / V2.0 / 2671 / A.7.0.6. Its ATVV
service and characteristic topology were observed on the current device. Across
separate connections it returned the complete capability responses
`0b0100000300780000` and `0b0100020300780000`; both describe ATVV v1, codec 2,
16 kHz and 120-byte frames. Local device binding, independent audio and key
controls, per-hold decoding, bounded buffering and dedicated CoreAudio routing
are project modifications. Physical HID input, remote audio packets and the
system end-to-end path remain installation-time tests; this notice does not
claim that they have passed. Original and modification notices are retained.
The full GPLv3 text is in LICENSE.

## Audio driver source

OpenRemoteAudio is an unofficial modification of the GPLv3 source of
[BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole), fixed revision
`e2b22aaaba4e507a097131704bf96dabc004d9cf` (v0.7.1).
Copyright 2019–2026 Existential Audio Inc.

The original license, exact source hashes and modifications are documented
under driver/. The driver uses this project's own name, bundle identity and
devices. We do not redistribute the official BlackHole installer, binaries,
icon or package artwork, and do not imply an affiliation or endorsement.
Source-code licensing does not grant additional upstream trademark rights.

The visible-input USB transport compatibility approach was independently
adapted after reviewing [HD838A/remote-mic-app](https://github.com/HD838A/remote-mic-app)
at revision `9e019112fc88534004641499b0b1efc50b491e5e` (GPL-3.0-only). That project
documents a BlackHole-derived USB-reported device for applications that omit
ordinary virtual microphones. OpenRemoteAudio applies the idea only to its
visible input; its hidden writer remains Virtual. No name, identifier, binary,
logo or icon from that project is included.

## Typeless compatibility adaptation

The Typeless compatibility implementation directly adapts source and test
logic from [HD838A/remote-mic-app](https://github.com/HD838A/remote-mic-app),
fixed revision `9e019112fc88534004641499b0b1efc50b491e5e`, GPL-3.0-only,
copyright (C) 2026 SayAll contributors. In particular, the transactional
`UserKeyMapping` policy, software Fn-key injection, and the paired Fn-tap voice
session controller were adapted from the upstream
`RemoteVoiceFunctionMapper.swift`, `KeyboardInjector.swift`,
`VoiceFnTapSessionController.swift`, their integration, and related tests.

This project's modifications bind the transaction to the selected RC003-MS
location and require every matching HID service at that location to map the
physical voice-key F5 usage to usage zero. The complete neutralization is
checked again before every audio stream. Audio is held in a bounded pre-roll
until the opening Fn tap succeeds; after release, queued audio is drained for
at most 0.75 seconds before the closing Fn tap. Generation tracking, cancelled
tasks and explicit shutdown/restore paths isolate rapid consecutive sessions
and clean up on disable, device change, failure and application exit.

This compatibility mode is disabled by default. The user has confirmed the
basic RC003-MS-to-Typeless path on the current test Mac; the full stress and
failure checklist and the added Doubao, WeChat Input and Shandianshuo presets
still require separate physical validation. It uses the main application's macOS Accessibility
permission to post Fn events; it does not require full key mapping, Input
Monitoring, the privileged HID takeover, or its administrator authorization.
The user must still select “遥控器麦克风” as Typeless's input device. No SayAll
or remote-mic-app name, bundle identifier, binary, logo, app icon, brand asset,
or bundled product photo is copied or redistributed by this project.

## Button mapping fallback adaptation

The non-exclusive RC003-MS HID reading and narrowly armed native-event
suppression strategy was adapted from
[HD838A/remote-mic-app](https://github.com/HD838A/remote-mic-app), fixed revision
`9e019112fc88534004641499b0b1efc50b491e5e`, GPL-3.0-only, copyright (C) 2026
SayAll contributors. The relevant upstream implementations are
`HIDRemoteMonitor.swift`, `KeyboardEventSuppressor.swift`, and
`RemoteButtons.swift`.

This project keeps its existing exact local RC003-MS binding, report parser,
held-key state machine and configurable key output. It first attempts exclusive
access; when macOS refuses that operation but permits shared reading, it listens
only to the bound device and arms suppression for the measured native event
corresponding to each just-observed remote edge. Synthetic mapped output is
marked and is not suppressed. This avoids requiring the unsuccessful
administrator/helper input-access path. Physical validation of every button
and suppression edge remains an installation-time acceptance step.

## Apple frameworks

The application uses system-supplied SwiftUI, AppKit, IOKit, CoreBluetooth,
CoreAudio, AudioToolbox and related Apple frameworks. The repository does not
redistribute Apple SDKs, Xcode, signing certificates or private signing keys.

## Assets and excluded components

The default remote control is drawn by SwiftUI. A user can import their own
photo locally; its rights remain with its owner. No user photo, diagnostic
recording, private configuration, screen capture or actual pairing identity
is included in the source or installer payload.

This product does not include Sparkle, Qt/PySide, Frida, VB-CABLE, the upstream
Windows application or its photo. Notices for those unused upstream
components do not represent this product's contents.

## Corresponding source

Any public binary release must provide its matching complete source archive,
including driver source, patches, configuration and installation/build
scripts, alongside the package. A development build is not a notarized public
release. Release assets and their source archive must remain version-matched.

License notice for JavaScript queues
-------------------------------------

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
